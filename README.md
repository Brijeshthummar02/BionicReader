# [BionicReader](https://bionicreader.vercel.app/) - read blazingly fast!

**BionicReader** is a simple web application that reads and formats text for faster reading by applying a bold style to the first half of each word.

Our brain can often predict a word after seeing just the first 2-3 letters, ignoring the rest. This ability can double reading speed, making it faster and more efficient. This is the advantage of bionic reading, which leverages our brain's natural prediction capabilities to enhance comprehension and speed.

## Usage

To use the Bionic Reader, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NisooJadhav/BionicReader.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. You'll see a text input field, a "SUBMIT" button, and a space to display the formatted text.

4. Enter or paste your text into the input field.

5. Click the "SUBMIT" button.

6. The application will format the text by making the first half of each word bold and displaying it below.

## How it Works

The `app.js` file contains the JavaScript code that handles the formatting of the text. It splits the input text into words, and for each word, it makes the first half bold and combines it with the remaining part of the word.

The `style.css` file is responsible for styling the web page. It sets the background, fonts, and styles for various elements like the text input, button, and the animated text at the top.

## Installation

You can run this application by simply opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. There are no additional dependencies or installation steps required.
