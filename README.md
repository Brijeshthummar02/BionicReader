# BionicReader - Read Blazingly Fast!

BionicReader is a simple web application that formats text for faster reading by applying a bold style to the first half of each word, helping you read at double the speed. It's a great tool for students, researchers, and anyone looking to improve their reading efficiency.

Our brain can often predict a word after seeing just the first 2-3 letters, ignoring the rest. This ability enhances reading speed and efficiency. Bionic reading leverages this by using bold text to help you grasp content quickly and improve comprehension.

üåô New Dark Mode Toggle
For a better reading experience, especially at night, use the dark mode toggle to switch between light and dark themes.

üîß How it Works
The app.js file contains the JavaScript code that formats the text. It splits the input text into words and applies bold formatting to the first half of each word.
The style.css file defines the overall look and feel of the page, including background, fonts, and styles for various elements like the text input, button, and the animated text at the top.
üöÄ Installation
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. No additional dependencies or setup is required.
